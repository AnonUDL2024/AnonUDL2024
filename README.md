Unzip UDLmp.zip

the "UDL experiments" notebook has code for running VCL experiments (you must edit the code to change directory path to path of where you wish to save data)

data folder contains data from the results displayed in the report

the "results plotter" notebook can be used to plot results in "data" or any new runs which you conduct with "UDL experiments" (again, one must change the root and path variables in data to point at one's desired directories)
